# discord-bot

##Main Planned features:
### TODO list:
Shared and personal
Combine with reminders

### Counter
 
Count how many message that match a regex were sent


Add new counters / add new regexes to current counter 

Example:

A counter with:


regex: "fu.* proxy"
would count how many times people complained about proxy issues

Implementation considerations:

How many regexes/counters is the limit until we are too slow?
Can we avoid having to iterate through multiple regexes to check for each message?

### Reminders

Set reminders and stuff

Support a simple format
and
Have support for advanced (cron based?) format

Support personal reminders on DM to bot?


## Secondary features:

### Slot machine
